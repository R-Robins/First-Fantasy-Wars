Turn based RPG made in Unity.  
Personal Documentation: https://github.com/R-Robins/First-Fantasy-Wars/blob/main/First_Fantasy_Wars_Personal_Documentation.pdf
I was unable to retrieve final group documentaion or documentation for other group members due to losing a computer. A UI was made after the posted documentation for menu navigation and icons were made for unit control. A lot of work was personally done for this project by me and it was a fantastic learning experience. 

First Fantasy Wars is a multiplayer game made within the Unity engine.  Multiplayer is only supported locally. Each player starts with 5 units which can be chosen from 3 base classes: a ranged, a melee, and a support class. Three out of five abilities are selectable for each class. These ability and class combinations can be saved as “Loadouts” so they may be used immediately while playing instead of re-selecting every game. Players take turns spawning in units on opposite sides of the map and after placement the game can begin. Every turn a player has control of one unit that may do a single movement and action before the turn ends. A turn may be ended manually as well if no movement or action is to take place. Victory happens when one player defeats all of the units of the other, and a celebratory dance will occur for the characters. 

The game is playable, but not complete. A semester was given for its creation and not all desired features had time to be implemented. There are some bugs and room for improvement.

Features:  
-Hexagon tiles for character placement and movement, including verticality    
-Custom pathfinding using A* search algorithm  
-Terrain: difficult terrain and impassible terrain (lava).  
-Numerous units, abilities, animations, and sound effects  
-Music created through the music department at San Francisco State University  
-One map supporting two players  

Notes:  
I was unable to upload the resources folder due to size limits on GitHub.
