# First-Fantasy-Wars

Turn based RPG made in Unity.  

Features:  
-Hexagon tiles for character placement and movement, including verticality    
-Custom pathfinding using A* search algorithm  
-Terrain: difficult terrain and impassible terrain (lava).  

-Numerous units, abilities, animations, and sound effects  
-Music created through the music department at San Francisco State University

Gameplay:  
Players are given control of a team of units with the goal of wiping out the other player's characters. The game ends when one player has no remaining units. Units can do one movement and one action every turn. A player may choose to skip or end their turn early. Turns occur one unit at a time before passing to the other player and cycles to the next available unit.

Notes:
I was unable to upload the resources folder due to size limits on GitHub.
